HOW IT WORKS:
The page has 9 rows for each corresponding hour in a 9:00-5:00 hours stretch. There are textareas in each row that allow the user
to input whatever they so choose. They can then save their inputs by clicking the calendar button to the right of the textarea. This
will allow the user to save their inputs to local storage and retain their inputs even if they leave the page.# homework5
